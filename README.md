- **User Interface:** Create an engaging and intuitive interface that allows users to sign up, browse medications, add items to their cart, and securely place orders.
- **Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly error handling and notifications using `react-toastify` to guide the user through any issues encountered during the use of the application.
